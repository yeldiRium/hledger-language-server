## language server
- [x] bug: currently hover should give the account name under cursor, but it can't deal with the resolved includes
- [ ] cache files and track changes in memory
    - [x] extract cache into dedicated module
    - [ ] maybe add versioning?
    - [x] test it
    - optimizations:
        - [ ] don't parse file to AST in each subsequent request, but once after adding the file to the cache
        - [ ] don't parse the file immediately after adding it to the cache, but memoize the AST after it is requested the first time
- completion
    - account names
        - [ ] prefilter list
        - [ ] remove the currently hovered account name from the list, since it is incomplete
- [ ] code completion for account names
    - [ ] based on prefix-syntax, e.g. `exp:Ca:Che` should suggest `expenses:Cash:Checking`, if it exists
